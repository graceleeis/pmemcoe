### 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存常见问题解答 (FAQ)-Part 1
Q: 能否介绍一下英特尔® 傲腾™ 技术?
A:	Intel Optane technology is the unique combination of Intel® Optane™ memory media with Intel’s advanced system memory controller, interface hardware, and software IP. Intel Optane technology is offered on a variety of client and data center form factors to unleash vast system-performance potential in a range of products.

The first new technology of its type in 25 years, Intel Optane technology revolutionizes computer architecture for clients, workstations, and servers, delivering new value to users around the world. This new technology creates an inflection point in how PCs, workstations, and data centers are redesigned and re-engineered. Its industry-leading combination of low latency, high endurance, high quality of service (QoS), and high throughput allows the creation of solutions that remove data bottlenecks, thus unleashing CPU utilization and opening myriad possibilities across uses and industries.

Q:	支撑英特尔傲腾的底层关键技术是什么？, and is it susceptible to the same shortage issues as other types of solid-state drives (SSDs)?
A:	The primary technology underlying Intel Optane technology products is a new memory and storage media that is inherently different from NAND. It is transistor-less and bit-addressable, faster and more durable, and avoids many shortcomings of NAND drives. Intel Optane memory media architecture allows
Intel Optane technology to act like DRAM (byte addressability, high endurance, write in place) or traditional storage (block addressability), depending on the use case or product form factor.

Q: 有没有与英特尔傲腾类似的或者互相竞争的技术?
A:	目前我们并不知道有任何与英特尔傲腾直接竞争的产品或技术。Our technology is a new approach and is the first breakthrough of its kind in memory technology in 25 years. We do expect the competition to follow our lead on storage-class memory. We have been working for 10 years on Intel Optane technology, and we have worked through the hard issues of going from building one cell, to an array of cells, to high volume manufacturing.

Q: 目前英特尔有哪些产品使用了傲腾技术？
A: 当前主要有两类产品使用了傲腾技术，一类是英特尔傲腾持久内存，一类是英特尔傲腾SSD，他们分别面向不同的应用场景与需求。

Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存是什么?
A:	Intel Optane DC persistent memory is a memory technology that delivers high-performance intelligence, is byte-addressable, offers higher capacity than DRAM at lower cost, and, unlike DRAM, it can retain its data even when power is off.

Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存的物理形式是什么?
A: Intel Optane DC persistent memory is a memory technology that delivers high-performance intelligence, is byte-addressable, offers higher capacity than DRAM at lower cost, and, unlike DRAM, it can retain its data even when power is off.

Q: 傲腾持久内存与傲腾SSD的主要区别是什么？
A: 从物理形式上看，英特尔傲腾持久内存采用DIMM模组形式，外观上与普通的DRAM无异，可以插在标准的DDR4内存插槽上；而英特尔傲腾SSD有多种物理接口，包括PCIe Mxxx和xxx。从使用模式来看，傲腾持久内存一般被当作普通内存或者通过mmap的形式来使用，提供字节寻址的能力，而英特尔傲腾SSD则被当作标准的块设备来使用，提供按照块来寻址的能力。傲腾持久内存主要针对对内存容量有要求或者需要高性能持久化的应用场景，而傲腾SSD则主要针对传统的基于块设备的高性能存储系统。

Q: 英特尔傲腾持久内存与英特尔傲腾SSD使用相同的介质吗？
A:	是的，他们使用同样的介质，因此都具备低延迟，高带宽，高耐久性等特点。


Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存与DRAM的差别是什么?
A: 

Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存可以替代DRAM吗?
A:	Intel Optane DC persistent memory augments DRAM to expand system memory well beyond what is possible from DRAM alone.

Q: 与DRAM相比，英特尔®傲腾™持久内存的价值是什么?
A:	Unlike DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory is non-volatile and retains data across power cycles. This can enhance performance because applications don’t have to wait for data to be written out to the disk to be made permanent, and it can shorten restart times because data does not have to be retrieved from disk to get the service operational again. That’s particularly important for large, in-memory databases where uptime is critical. Intel Optane DC persistent memory can provide affordable, large-memory capacities with native persistence in module sizes up to 512 GB, which is 4x larger than the 128 GB DDR4 DIMMs available today. We expect to offer persistent memory at a lower cost-per-GB than equivalent quantities of DRAM. Fundamentally, applications that have been optimized to take advantage of the persistent nature of Intel Optane DC persistent memory are able to write data to persistent storage at memory speeds, rather than storage speeds. This means orders-of-magnitude lower latency and significant increases in execution efficiency.

Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存有哪些应用案例?
A:	Some of the initial use cases for persistent memory include more cost-effective in-memory databases, greater virtual-machine (VM) and container density, more efficient distributed cloud services, higher database performance, high-performance storage, and faster restart times. Software vendors that have stated their support or publicly demonstrated interest in persistent memory include Aerospike*, Apache Cassandra*, GigaSpaces*, Java*, KVM*, Microsoft*, Oracle*, RedHat*, Redis*, RocksDB*, SAP*, SUSE*, and VMware*. We continue to engage Intel’s unmatched global ecosystem to deliver solutions in alignment with our development milestones.

Q: 英特尔®傲腾™持久内存现在可以替代SAN吗?
A: No, but Intel Optane DC SSDs can help as the caching tier, not the raw-capacity tier

Q:在很多场景下，既可以使用英特尔®傲腾™持久内存，也可以使用英特尔®傲腾™SSD，那么二者是否会形成竞争关系?
A: In most cases, the benefits and uses of the two products are very different. There are a handful of use cases where a customer could make a choice between the two based on specific balancing of performance and cost. There are also use cases in which Intel Optane DC SSDs and Intel Optane DC persistent memory can be combined to deliver on customer data-performance requirements. As an example, the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X can be used as a fast-cache storage tier in combination with Intel Optane DC persistent memory. Intel Optane DC persistent memory works only on 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, whereas Intel Optane DC SSDs can be used with multiple platform generations, including 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and previous-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors

Q: 为了使用英特尔傲腾持久内存，软件厂商必须重写他们的应用程序吗?
A: When Intel Optane technology is accessed as storage or as volatile memory in Memory Mode, no software modifications are needed. To get the maximum benefits of Intel Optane DC persistent memory, including non-volatility, applications require modification to access Intel Optane DC persistent memory in App Direct Mode. Many major software vendors, including SAP, have already updated applications to support persistent memory. We encourage software vendors to update their applications to unleash the full capabilities of Intel Optane technology

Q: 英特尔傲腾持久内存能给用户带来什么收益?
A:	Intel Optane DC technology unleashes new potential for data centers to optimize their infrastructures to meet their specific memory and storage needs. In some cases, this could lead to a better overall cost structure. From Intel® QLC 3D NAND drives to Intel Optane DC SSDs to Intel Optane DC persistent memory to DRAM, Intel storage technologies and products offer data center architects flexibility to match performance, capacity, reliability, and affordability to their business applications and workloads.
